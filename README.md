# Interview Pro

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Environment Setup

This application requires an OpenAI API key to function. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env.local`
2. Replace `your_openai_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key
3. Restart the development server if it's already running

The `.env.local` file should look like this:
```
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_actual_openai_key_here
```

Your API key is stored only in your local environment and is never sent to any server other than OpenAI's API endpoints.

## Deploying to CPanel

This React application is configured to work seamlessly on CPanel servers. Follow these steps to deploy:

### Building the application

1. Run the build command: `npm run build`
2. This will create a `build` directory containing static files ready for deployment

### Uploading to CPanel

1. Log in to your CPanel account
2. Navigate to File Manager
3. Go to the `public_html` directory or the subdirectory where you want to host the app
4. Upload all contents of the `build` directory

### Important Notes

- The `.htaccess` file is already included in the build and configured for React routing
- The application uses relative paths (`"homepage": "."`) so it can be deployed in any directory
- If deploying to a subdirectory, no additional configuration is needed
- For custom domains or subdomains, the same build will work without modifications

### Troubleshooting

If routes aren't working correctly:
1. Make sure mod_rewrite is enabled on your CPanel server
2. Verify the `.htaccess` file was uploaded correctly
3. Check file permissions (`.htaccess` should be readable by the server)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
