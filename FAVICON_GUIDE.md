# Super Interview Pro - Favicon Upload Guide

This guide explains how to properly add favicon files to the application.

## Required Favicon Files

The following favicon files should be placed in the `public` directory of your project:

- favicon.ico (main favicon file)
- favicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- favicon-96x96.png
- apple-icon-57x57.png
- apple-icon-60x60.png
- apple-icon-72x72.png
- apple-icon-76x76.png
- apple-icon-114x114.png
- apple-icon-120x120.png
- apple-icon-144x144.png
- apple-icon-152x152.png
- apple-icon-180x180.png
- android-icon-192x192.png
- ms-icon-144x144.png

## Upload Instructions

1. **Generate Icons (Optional)**
   If you need to generate these icons from a single image, you can use a tool like [favicon-generator.org](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) or [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)

2. **Uploading to Development Environment**
   - Place all icon files in the `/public` directory of your React project
   - These files will be copied to the build output when you run `npm run build`

3. **Uploading to Production**
   - When deploying to production, upload all icon files to the root directory of your server
   - If you've deployed to a subdirectory, make sure the icons are in that subdirectory

## Verifying Icons

To verify your icons are working correctly:

1. Run the application (`npm start` for local testing)
2. Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)
3. Navigate to the "Application" tab
4. Check the "Manifest" section to ensure icon paths are correct
5. Ensure there are no 404 errors related to favicon files in the "Console" tab

## Troubleshooting

If icons are not displaying correctly:

1. Make sure all files are in the correct location
2. Check that file names match exactly what's referenced in the HTML and manifest.json
3. Clear your browser cache and reload
4. Verify file permissions on the server (should be readable by the web server)
